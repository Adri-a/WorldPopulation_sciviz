# 8 Billions: observations
From **15th November 2022**, 8 billions people are on Earth! What a marvelous goal we reached!

But how did we reach this number? Has global population always been going up? Or have there been periods where it diminished?
Which continents have been contributing the most to the total these past ~70 years?
What are the predictions for the next 10, 50 years? How many should we be by 2100?

With this project for our SciViz class we tried to take a look at some available datasets and answer to some of these questions.

Our approach consisted mainly in exploring the datasets we decided to use and find the reason behind certain phenomena we observed.
(e.g. Why is there a decrease in the global population in year X? What caused it?)

## Datasets used:
- population 1950-2100: UN datasets
- population 1800-1950: Gap Minder
- population 1300-1800: HYDE (the ones we used are actually part of a larger project with estimates up to 10'000 B.C.)

More references (apart from simply datasets) can be found at the end of the presentation.

## What we used:
The code to analyze and manage the datasets was written entirely in Python, using:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Folium
